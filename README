Usage:
run the server using the command:
python Server.py <port number> <max_user_count>
default port will be 58888 and max user count will be 5 if there's no commandline arguments.
The server will listen for incoming connection and will accept and handle up to max_user_count 
connections at a time, and handle each one using multithreading.

run the client using the command:
python User.py <host> <port>
If there is no commandline arguments, then default port will be 58888 and default host will be 
localhost.
The client also using multithreading to work. One thread is for receiving and handling data from the
server, and another thread is for accepting user input and send commands to the server.
